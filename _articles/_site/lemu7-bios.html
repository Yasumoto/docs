<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a BIOS password set, clear this prior to updating. This can be done by holding down <kbd>F2</kbd> when you computer starts, and going to the <u>Security</u> tab.  Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the Supervisor/Boot passwords, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> when prompted for a new password.  This password is not the same as the user account password in the operating system.  This is the hardware level, BIOS password, that needs cleared.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove all external USB drives and devices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure your computer is set to boot with UEFI mode enabled in the Boot menu.  If the computer has not been changed to Legacy boot mode in the BIOS, then UEFI boot is the default setting.  UEFI boot mode does not show a System76 logo when the computer first starts, while BIOS mode does.</p>

<h3 id="updating-bios">Updating BIOS</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Format a USB drive with MBR (msdos) FAT32 formating.  To format a USB drive, use the built-in program <u>Disks</u> or the installable program <u>Gparted</u>.  Do not use <u>UNetbootin</u> as it adds additional files that are not needed.  Make sure the USB drive is clean before extracting the archive to the drive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download the <a href="/files/firmware/lemu7-bios.zip">lemu7.zip</a> file, double click the file to open it, click <strong>Extract</strong>, and choose the USB drive as the destination.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Connect AC power to the laptop. AC power is required to update.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restart your Lemur and hold <kbd>F7</kbd> during boot.  Choose the USB drive from the boot menu.  It will be labeled as the brand of USB drive, such as Sandisk or Cuzer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the prompt, type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fs1:</code> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (this switches to the USB drive to run the updates).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meset</code> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  This unlocks the ME for flashing.  The computer will turn off and reboot.  The fans will be at 100% for the next steps.  If they are not, please plug in AC power and try again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hold <kbd>F7</kbd> to boot from USB again.  Type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fs1:</code> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>

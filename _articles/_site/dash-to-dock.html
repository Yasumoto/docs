<p>Pop!_OS and Ubuntu both contain an application dock on the left side of the screen. In Pop!_OS, the dock is only visible when the Activities menu is open. In Ubuntu, the dock is always visible. By installing a GNOME extension called Dash to Dock, you can adjust this preference, move the dock to the bottom of the screen, and more.</p>

<h1 id="dash-to-dock-on-ubuntu">Dash to Dock on Ubuntu</h1>

<p>Ubuntu includes a lightweight version of Dash to Dock, which is why the dock already displays on the left side of the screen by default. When you enable the full version of Dash to Dock, it will override the built-in version.</p>

<p>To install Dash to Dock on Ubuntu, you will first need to install the “native host connector,” which allows Firefox to install and remove GNOME Shell extensions. This component is installed by default in Pop!_OS, but it is not installed by default in Ubuntu. Open a terminal and run this command to install the native host connector:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Enter your password and press “y” to confirm if necessary.</p>

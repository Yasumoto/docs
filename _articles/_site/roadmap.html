<h1 id="pop_os-roadmap">Pop!_OS Roadmap</h1>

<p>This roadmap details features which are currently-planned to be implemented in Pop!_OS, as well
as major features which were added to Pop!_OS during previous release cycles. Only features
specific to Pop!_OS will be listed here. To see how features are chosen, see the
<a href="/articles/pop-os-development-approach/">Pop!_OS Development Approach page</a>.</p>

<p>However, note that feature development in Pop!_OS is not exclusive to any particular point release,
as we follow a rolling-release strategy for updates to projects which we maintain. This means that
features are added to Pop!_OS as soon as they are finished, instead of being withheld to the next
point release. When features are completed, they are added to the latest “stable” and
“long term stable (LTS)” point releases, whenever possible.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="currently-planned-features">Currently-Planned Features</h2>

<p>These are features which we would either like to, or are already in the process of, implementing.
As these are completed, they will be listed underneath a release cycle, indicating which cycle
the feature was implemented during. When a feature is listed as being implemented during the 20.04
release cycle, this means that it was completed before 20.04 was released, and thus was available
on release for 20.04.</p>

<h3 id="async-fetcher">Async Fetcher</h3>

<p>A new Rust crate built around asynchronous I/O, using Rust’s async / await syntax. This project will be used across all Pop!_OS and System76 projects for caching, fetching, and validating files fetched from HTTP/S file servers. Features shall include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futures03</code> streams</li>
  <li>Concurrently fetching multiple files at the same time</li>
  <li>Using multiple concurrent connections per file (as parts) to increase throughput</li>
  <li>Using multiple mirrors to fetch different parts of the same file from</li>
  <li>Defining minimum and maximum part size</li>
  <li>Definining maximum requests per per, and maximum number of files to fetch concurrently</li>
  <li>Checking modified timestamps and content length to determine when fetching is required</li>
  <li>Optional checksum validation (MD5 / SHA256)</li>
  <li>Cancellation, timeout, and retry handling</li>
  <li>Resumable downloads, when a download is interrupted</li>
  <li>Command line client with IPC and RPC support, w/ process isolation support</li>

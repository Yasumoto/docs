<p>In order to format the drive that has your OS on it we will need to boot from either a live disk or the Pop Recovery partition.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Formatting the entire OS drive (including the Recovery partition) requires booting from a live disk or another drive.</p>

<h3 id="disks-application">Disks application</h3>

<p>The <u>Disks</u> application can be used to format the drive to remove any personal data. Disks comes pre-installed on Pop!_OS and Ubuntu.</p>

<p>In this screenshot the drive is a USB Flash Drive, though the concept is the same for any drive, including the drive where your OS is installed. First left-click on the drive on the left side then left-click on the top right menu with three dots (three lines on older releases).</p>

<p>Now select the <strong>Format Disk…</strong> option then make sure to have the ‘Compatible with modern systems and hard drives &gt; 2TB (GPT)’ selected (you can use either the Quick option or the Slow option).</p>

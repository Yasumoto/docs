<p>Lightworks is a powerful video-editing tool used by industry professionals. This tutorial provides steps on installing Lightworks in Pop!_OS.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The stable version of Lightworks will not install correctly on current OS versions because it requires an obsolete <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libssl</code> package. Instead, select the Beta download from the Linux download page <a href="https://www.lwks.com/get-linux">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="register-on-lightworks-website">Register on Lightworks’ Website</h2>

<p>In order to download the beta, you are required to register an account on Lightworks’ website.</p>

<p>Upon registration, Lightworks will send a confirmation email with a verification link. If you do not receive the email, it may be helpful to check your “spam” folder.</p>

<h2 id="download-the-beta">Download the Beta</h2>

<p>Once your registration is confirmed, sign in to the Lightworks website and revisit the <a href="https://www.lwks.com/get-linux">download page</a>. The sign-in link is located in the top right of the webpage.</p>

<p>For first time downloads, accept the EULA. The checkbox is below the blue download buttons and will not reappear on later visits to the website.</p>

<p>Click on the blue “Download DEB” button to download the beta version of Lightworks.</p>

<p>If you’re using Firefox, the browser will ask whether you want to open or save the file.</p>

<h2 id="install-the-beta">Install the Beta</h2>

<p>In Pop!_OS, the default application for opening .deb files is Eddy. Choose the “Open” option, and Eddy will launch automatically when the download is complete. (If you are using a different web browser and you saved the .deb file, locate the .deb file in the <strong>Files</strong> app and open it.)</p>

<p>Click the green “Install” button in the top-right corner of Eddy to install the package. When the process is finished, a red “Uninstall” button will appear in its place.</p>

<p>Now, the Lightworks launcher will appear in the Activities menu.</p>

<p>Once the .deb file is downloaded, instead of using Eddy, it can also be installed from a terminal by running the following commands:</p>

sudo apt install ./Lightworks*.deb
</code></pre></div></div>

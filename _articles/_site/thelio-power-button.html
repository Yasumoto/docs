<p>If you’ve purchased a new top case for your Thelio (or received one for a support case), you may need to move the power button from your old top case to the new one. Conversely, if you’ve received a replacement power button, you may need to remove the old power button from your top case and install the new one.</p>

<p>The power button assembly is held on by a single nut inside the case. First, unplug the power button’s wire from the 90-degree connector.</p>

<p>Next, unscrew the nut from the power button. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to loosen the nut.</p>

<p>Once the nut has been loosened, use your fingers to remove it the rest of the way.</p>

<p>With the wire unplugged and the nut removed, the power button can be pushed out the front of the case.</p>

<p>The black plastic rectangle inside of the case will also be loose at this point, and can be removed.</p>

<p>First, line up the black plastic rectangle with the hole inside of the case.</p>

<p>While holding the black plastic rectangle to the hole, feed the power button wire through the hole and push the power button into the case.</p>

<p>While holding the button in from the front, thread the power button wire through the nut, then screw the nut onto the power button.</p>

<p>Tighten the nut with a pair of needle-nose pliers to ensure the plastic bracket doesn’t move around later.</p>

<p>Finally, plug the power button’s wire into the 90-degree connector so the red wire is on the left.</p>

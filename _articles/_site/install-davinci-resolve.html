<h2 id="intel-gpus">Intel GPU’s</h2>

<p>DaVinci Resolve does not support Intel GPU’s due to the lack of OpenCL support.</p>

<h3 id="install-prerequisite-packages">Install prerequisite packages</h3>

<p>The following packages will be needed to build and install DaVinci Resolve:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt install libssl1.1 ocl-icd-opencl-dev fakeroot xorriso
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>DaVinci Resolve requires either CUDA or OpenCL. If you are using an NVIDIA GPU, install CUDA using this command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt install system76-cuda-latest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are using an AMD GPU, install the AMDGPU-PRO driver from AMD’s website <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support">here</a> for OpenCL support. In order to add OpenCL support the following command will need to be used when installing the AMDGPU Pro driver:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo ./amdgpu-pro-install -y --opencl=legacy,pal
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then reboot the system once that completes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo systemctl reboot
</code></pre></div></div>

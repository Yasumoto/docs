<p>Pop!_OS uses GNOME Shell for launching apps, switching windows, managing workspaces, etc. Ubuntu and previous versions of GNOME Shell supported “status icons” or “AppIndicators” where installed apps could add arbitrary icons to the shell. In GNOME Shell 3.26, this functionality was <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/2017/08/31/status-icons-and-gnome/">removed in favor of other APIs</a>. This extension was added into the default install of Pop!_OS starting with 20.04 LTS.</p>

<p>If you are running a Pop!_OS version older than 20.04, some apps you use (like Dropbox) might not have been updated and thus might depend on being able to draw a status icon. Fortunately it is easy to add legacy status icon support with a GNOME Shell extension.</p>

<p>The extension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gnome-shell-extension-appindicator</code> works well for this and is what we recommend users of Pop!_OS install if they need status icons. To install, open the <strong>Terminal</strong> app (<kbd><span class="fl-pop-key"></span></kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) and type:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-appindicator
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. If prompted, type your password and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The extension is now installed, but you need to enable it.</p>

<h2 id="enable">Enable</h2>

<p>In the <strong>Terminal</strong> app or from the <strong>Enter a command</strong> dialog (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>), type:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gnome-shell-extension-prefs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. In the <strong>Shell Extensions</strong> window that comes up, turn on the <strong>KStatusNotifierItem/AppIndicator Support</strong> switch.</p>

<p>Lastly, you may need to <strong>log out</strong> and back in for icons to show up. When you do, any app’s status icons will show up at the right-side of the top panel, next to the system menu.</p>

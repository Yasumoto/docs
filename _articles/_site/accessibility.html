<p>Pop!_OS shares many of the same accessibility options as Gnome. These accessibility options allow for Pop!_OS to be used by as many people in the community as possible. If there are additional tools or options that you would like to see added to Pop!_OS in the future please let us know and we will see if implementation is possible.</p>

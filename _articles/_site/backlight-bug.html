<p>This is new bug introduced by the current version of the NVIDIA driver. It prevents the internal screen backlight from turning on after the screen is turned off when idle.</p>

<p>The current work-around is to press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>, followed by <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd> after resuming from the screen idle timeout. Other options are disabling the screen idle timeout, only suspending (since it doesnâ€™t have this issue), or using a screensaver to blank the screen.</p>

<p>We have been working with NVIDIA to develop a solution to this problem. It will be released in the next version of the NVIDIA driver after 375.20. Once they release it, we will point our system76-driver-nvidia package to that version, so your normal updates will resolve this issue.</p>

<p>Any additional people that mark <span style="color: #093;">Does this bug affect you?</span> on that bug report will help gain additional traction from developers to get this issue resolved.</p>

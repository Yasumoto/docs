<p>To add a printer to your System76 Computer, click the Ubuntu icon at the top left of your screen and type the word <em>Printers</em> then choose the <u>Printers</u> application in the search box. In the <u>Printers</u> Application, click the <strong>Add</strong> button and a box will pop up with different options. Wait a few seconds for printers to appear in the Device List.</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-a-printer-ubuntu/selectcorrectprinter.png" alt="Add Printer" /></p>

<p>Select the correct printer and click <strong>Forward</strong>. The computer will search for the correct Drivers to enable the printer. A box may come up that says ‘Installable Options’ which you can select any other options available for your printer and then click <strong>Forward</strong> again.

<p>First in the <u>Software &amp; Updates</u> settings go to the <strong>Other Software</strong> tab, and check the first item, <strong>Canonical Partners</strong>. Then, after closing the <u>Software &amp; Updates</u> program, add the driver with this command for HP:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt install hplip
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you would like to use a guided GUI application from HP, you will need to install a python dependency:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt install python3-pyqt5
hp-setup
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Epson printer drivers are in the <strong>printer-driver-escpr</strong> package and is also installed by default. You may need to install the <strong>lsb</strong> package for some printer versions:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt install lsb printer-driver-escpr
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Automatically installed printers will work fine, but if you need to make changes to the configuration of the printers, you will need to add your user to the ‘lpadmin’ group. To do that run the following command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo usermod -aG lpadmin $USER
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And when adding the printer, select type of connection as <strong>DNS-SD</strong>, and then <strong>Forward</strong>, and then <strong>ESC/P-R</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If the printer stops working, open the <u>Printers</u> Application again and right-click on the printer and select <strong>Delete</strong> to remove the printer and its settings. Repeat the steps above to add the printer and try printing the test page again. This process usually resolves many printing issues.</p>

<p>To look at the CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) configuration and status window, please open this webpage:</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:631">localhost:631</a></p>

If you would like to share this printer with others on your local network, click on the ‘Admin’ link, under Server, click on the “Share printers connected to this system” and save the changes. Other computers on your network should than see that printer.</p>
